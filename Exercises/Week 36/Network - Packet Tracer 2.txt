# 1. Preperation
Make sure you have the network up and running fra last weeks exercises. ("Network - Packet Tracer 1").


# 2. Adding more networks
Make another small network consisting of:
	1x Switch
	3x End user PC's
	1x DHCP Server
Configure the PC's so that they get there network information from the DHCP Server.


# 3. Yet another network
Make a third network consisting of:
	1x Switch
	1x DNS Server
	2x Web Server
Configure the servers so that they have a static IP addresses that makes sense for the network.


# 4. Connection between networks
* Add three routhers - one for every network.

* Switch off every routher and added a "Serial" module and turn on the routhers agian.

* Connect the three networks with each other, by connecting the routhers with serial.
* Configure the routhers with a network, so that they can communicate with each other.
* Configure the routing table for each routher, so that they know where to send packages for other networks.


# 5. Reconfigure devices.
* Reconfigure the devices on the "first" network (the one from last weeks exercise) - so that they are using the DNS server from the "third" network.
* Use the simulation mode to make sure that your networks are running as expecting.
